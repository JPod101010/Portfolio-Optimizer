## Dear reader
- The project was build purely in python
- The aim of this project is to give the user some basic visuals and
understanding of quantitave basics
- Frontend was done in **streamlit** because i cannot code frontend in real
frontend tools
- If anyone is interest in explanation of the math concepts behind the visuals
go see **docs/**
- Really go see it!!
- There is no DATABASE! I dont have a server :( ... failed systems desing, soo you will have some MB of data on your device!
